# Introduction to Linux

##   What is Linux?

**LINUX**  is an operating system or a kernel distributed under an open-source license. Its functionality list is quite like UNIX. The kernel is a program at the heart of the Linux operating system that takes care of fundamental stuff, like letting hardware communicate with software.

Users, who are new to Linux, usually shun it by falsely considering it as a difficult and technical OS to operate but, to state the truth, in the last few years Linux operating systems have become a lot more user-friendly than their counterparts like Windows**,**  so trying them is the best way to know whether Linux suits you or not.

There are  **thousands of Linux based operating systems;**  most of them offer  **state-of-the-art security and applications**, **all of it for free!**

This is what Linux is all about, and now we will move on to how to install Linux and which Distribution you should choose.

## Why do you need an OS?

Every time you switch on your computer, you see a screen where you can perform different activities like write, browse the internet or watch a video. What is it that makes the computer hardware work like that? How does the processor on your computer know that you are asking it to run a mp3 file?

Well, it is the operating system or the kernel which does this work. So, to work on your computer, you need an Operating System(OS). In fact, you are using one as you read this on your computer. Now, you may have used popular OS's like Windows, Apple OS X, but here we will learn what Linux is and what benefits it offers over other OS choices.


## I am asked to Learn Unix? Then why Linux?

UNIX is called the mother of operating systems which laid out the foundation to Linux. Unix is designed mainly for mainframes and is in enterprises and universities. While Linux is fast becoming a household name for computer users, developers, and server environment. You may have to pay for a Unix kernel while in Linux it is free.

But, the  **commands used on both the operating systems are usually the same.**  There is not much difference between UNIX and Linux. Though they might seem different, at the core, they are essentially the same. Since  **Linux is a clone of UNIX**. So learning one is same as learning another.

### Components of Linux

In the above section, we have studied about the introduction to Linux so now we are going to learn the components of Linux. As Linux architecture primarily has these components: Hardware, Kernel, Shell and Utilities

-   **Hardware:**  Peripheral devices such as RAM, HDD, CPU together constitute Hardware layer for the LINUX operating system.
-   **Kernel:**  The Core part of the Linux OS is called Kernel, it is responsible for many activities of the LINUX operating system. It interacts directly with hardware, which provides low-level services like providing hardware details to the system. We have two types of kernels –  [Monolithic Kernel and MicroKernel](https://www.educba.com/monolithic-kernel-vs-microkernel/)
-   **Shell:**  The shell is an interface between the user and the kernel, it hides the complexity of functions of the kernel from the user. It accepts commands from the user and performs the action.
-   **Utilities:**  Operating system functions are granted to the user from the Utilities. Individual and specialized functions are can be utilized from the System utilities.

### Characteristics of Linux

After learning the Introduction to Linux and the main components of Linux we are going to learn the Characteristics of Linux. Linux can be utilized using commands, which does the following functions:
-   Linux commands are used to perform one or multiple tasks e.g. copy, paste, find, etc.
-   Using commands tasks can be carried out efficiently and effectively for executing some program

Commands are supposed to be typed in a shell, this is like a communicator between us and the core Linux, which converts the human code to be executed by hardware. We can execute the code to find something in a file, as well as we can write code to execute the more complex codes like we can execute a command on the output of one command for this we need to use the “|” (pipe separator) between two or more commands. This i.e. pipe operator acts as a joint for the two commands. Below we have the examples of both single commands and the multiple commands joint using the pipe.

e.g.

-   **grep –**  Search for a pattern in a file
-   **sort –**  Sort into order
-   **uniq –** Only show one copy of identical things this is the examples of the single, this commands can work individually or we can utilize them to fetch something using all of them as one e.g. grep ARC *txt | sort | uniq > output.txt

The above command will search all the files having the extension with ‘txt’ for the word “ARC” and it will save a copy of a record to a new file “output.txt”.

These were the few examples of commands, where we can utilize them to achieve our functionality.

### Current Application of Linux Systems

Developers of Linux had full concentration on networking services at the early stage, but the real block for the Linux was to support the office applications such as  [MS compatible office applications](https://www.educba.com/microsoft-office-application/)  like word processors, spreadsheets, presentations and the like. After getting all the roadblocks we had received a very stable freeware OS. Linux is highly used on the server side as it is considered as the most stable and reliable platform, providing database and trading services for companies like Amazon, the well-known online bookshop, US Post Office, the German army and many others. Internet service providers have found a firewall, proxy and web server, services of the Linux very useful and you can find Linux box within reach of every UNIX system administrator, as it has a very friendly, comfortable management systems. Linux is not only used in personal computers, laptops but also in small gadgets like PDA, mobile phones, smart watches, etc.

Thousands of companies and governments around the world are using Linux OS due to affordability, lower licensing fee and time and money.

Linux is used in many electronic devices, a list of few is given below:

-   Dell Inspiron Mini 9 and 12
-   Garmin Nuvi 860, 880, and 5000
-   Google Android Dev Phone 1
-   HP Mini 1000
-   Lenovo IdeaPad S9
-   Motorola MotoRokr EM35 Phone
-   One Laptop Per Child XO2
-   Sony Bravia Television
-   Sony Reader

### Advantages and Disadvantages of Linux

After going through all the components, characteristics and the wide Introduction to Linux, we are going to explore the advantages and disadvantages of Linux:

#### Advantages

Below are mentioned the advantages:

1.  Linux is free and can be downloaded from the internet, there is no hidden cost for registration, updates or anything.
2.  Linux is flexible i.e.  [Linux can be installed](https://www.educba.com/install-linux/)  in any hardware, if a user is not sure what OS on his/her machine can be installed he can go with Linux.
3.  Linux is developed so that it can run all the time without rebooting, and because of this feature, many applications can be scheduled at calm hours.
4.  Security model implemented for Linux is based on the Unix, it is very secure against internet and other attacks as well.
5.  Linux can be customized as per requirement and bug fixes are very fast as it is open source and we can find many people available on the internet for solutions.

#### Disadvantages

Below are mentioned the disadvantages:

1.  Linux is licensed under GNU Public License (GPL), which suggests anyone can change and distribute a changed version. So it is a bit confusing to find a suitable for our need version.
2.  Linux is not very user-friendly and it can be a bit confusing for the beginners.
